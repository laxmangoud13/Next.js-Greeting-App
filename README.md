Next.js Greeting App
This project is a simple single-page application built using Next.js (version 15.1), TypeScript, and Shadcn UI components. The app allows the user to input their name and receive a personalized greeting message. It also includes an explanation section to describe how the code works.

Features
Input Field: A text input field where the user can enter their name.
Submit Button: A button to submit the name and receive a greeting message.
Greeting Message: Displays a greeting message ("Hello [Name]!") after the form is submitted.
Explanation Section: Provides an explanation of how the code works, using Shadcn UI components like a card or accordion.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
Next.js 15.1: For building the server-rendered React application.
TypeScript: For type safety and ensuring better developer experience.
Shadcn UI: For building the input field, submit button, and explanation section with consistent styling.
Server Actions: Next.js 15.1 feature for handling server-side logic like processing the name input.

Code Explanation
The app is built using Next.js 15.1, which introduces server actions. Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

Input Field and Submit Button: The user inputs their name, and upon submitting, a server action is triggered. The action processes the input and sends back a greeting message.
Shadcn UI: We use Shadcn UI components to create a consistent UI design. The input field, button, and explanation section are styled using Shadcn's components.
Server Actions: When the user clicks the submit button, the server action is executed to process the input and return the greeting message.
Explanation Section: The explanation section, styled with a Shadcn UI card or accordion, explains how the code functions.
Styling
The app is styled using Shadcn UI components. For additional custom styling, feel free to modify the globals.css file or use Tailwind CSS classes (if you're using Tailwind).
ESLint and TypeScript
This project uses TypeScript for type safety, and ESLint is set up to ensure clean, error-free code. All code adheres to ESLint rules and passes TypeScript checks.
